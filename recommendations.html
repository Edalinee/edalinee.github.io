 	<h2>Nikki Burt Pre-Ap Chemistry</h2>
 	<p><i>Edaline is mature beyond her years and can always be counted on to assist not only her classmates, but myself as well.  She was a serious and hard working student who consistently performed toward the top of her class academically, yet was still able to allow her great personality to shine
 <br>
Edaline, during her time in my class, seemed to keep a very busy schedule and was involved in many extra curricular activities, however she seemed to thrive and flourish with her demanding schedule.  She is the type of student that any teacher, coach, or sponsor would be overjoyed to have in their class.</i></p>
