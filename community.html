<h1>Volunteering History</h1>
 	<p>Volunteering is an amazing chance for me to get engaged in my community, meet new people and meet my desire of helping others</p>
 	<h2> Hack  UTD</h2>
 	<p>In early 2016, I was provided a chance to <b>help in the set-up of a 24-hour hackathon</b> in my local area. A Hackathon is an event that provides periods of building and designing leisure code for the 500 of University of Texas at Dallas students it hosts, and encompasses a variety of prizes, competitions and games. In my time there <b> I served meals to the patrons, directed students to their designated areas, and disposed of excess waste.</b> In addition to the casual civil duties, I got to <b>engage in the life of college students and experienced coders</b>. I was able to <b>observe their style of coding and learn new aspects of programming</b>.</p>
 	<h2> Lake Rockwall Estates</h2>
 	<p>Beginning in the fall of 2015, <b>Every Tuesday</b> I volunteer at the Lake Rockwall Estates Community Center. The kids there range from age 5-16. There I aide in the <b>tutoring of the children and help with their homework</b>. The center has a large Hispanic population of youngsters which means that most of the children speak Spanish as their first language and that some of their homework was also in Spanish. My <b>background in the Spanish language</b> from high school made me the <b>only volunteer that could help the children on their homework in Spanish and relate to the kids on a different level</b>. Being around a plethora of minors also provided me with the skills to <b>resolve conflicts, instill verbal discipline, and create connections with the adolescents</b>. I enjoy the moments I spend connecting with each one of the children every time I walk through the door</p>
