 	<h2>National Junior Honor Society</h2>
 	<p>In my 8th grade school year (2012-2013) I was part of an organization called <b>National Junior Honor Society</b>, or NJHS. NJHS was a front for the honor students to come together and <b>serve the community</b>. I was elected <b>President</b> of this organization and was in charge of being a student leader and mentor for my peers in the group.</p>
 	<h2>National Honor Society </h2>
 	<p>Moving on from the middle school organization, in my sophomore year I was able to apply to be part of <b>National Honor Society</b>. This organization requires a total of 10 hours of <b>community service</b> for each semester and 20 hours for the summer months. My first semester of being in the club I was able to <b>exceed the limit with 21 community service hours</b>.</p>
 	<h2>National Math Honor Society (Mu Alpha Theta) </h2>
 	<p><b>National Math Honor Society</b> is a branch from the Honor Society Tree which also entails a plethora of volunteer hours. Being directed towards students who <b>love math</b>, I found this club as a perfect fit.</p>
 	<h2>CLAW</h2>
 	<p><b>CLAW</b> is an organization aimed at <b>helping the upcoming freshman in our school adjust to high school life</b>. My experiences being taught important values as a freshman inspired me to become a member of this club when I became a sophomore. CLAW teaches attributes like the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens.(Be Proactive, Begin with the End in Mind, Put First Things First, Seek First to Understand, Think Win-Win, Synergize, Sharpen the Saw)</p>
 	<h2>Hawkathon</h2>
 	<table>
 	<tr><td>
 	<p><b>Hawkathon or previously known as Dance Marathon</b> is an Organization <b>started by my friends and I to help raise money for sick kids at Children’s Hospital</b>. This organization is practiced in colleges as well and our common motto is “For the Kids (FTK)”, but “Hawkathon” is unique to our school. I am our <b>Treasurer but I also handle a deal of social relations like promotion of our fundraisers and obtaining sponsors</b></p></td>

 	<h2>Buisness Professionals of America </h2>
 	<p><b>Business Professionals of America or BPA</b> is an organization that encompasses many different topics for a student to learn and compete in. My topic was <b>C++</b>.Unfortunately after learning all year, events inspired me not to be able to compete. Nonetheless I served as the club’s <b>Secretary</b>.</p>
 	<h2>Clubs in Motion</h2>
 	<p>In my Junior Year I will be enrolling in my school’s <b>Model UN</b> which will teach me more about our growing world and the art of debating and speech making. I also enrolled as a founding member of our <b>Programming Club</b>, which is a fairly new addition and in the process of taking off.</p>
